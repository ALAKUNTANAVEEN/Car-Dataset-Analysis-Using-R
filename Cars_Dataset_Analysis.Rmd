# Stage 1: Data Loading and Initial Inspection

### Loading the Dataset
Initially, we import the car dataset from a CSV file by using the read.csv function.
```{r cars_data_10K}
cars_dataset <- read.csv("C:/Users/Naveen/OneDrive/Desktop/R Files/cars_data_10K.csv")
```

### Checking Dataset Structure and Summary
Using `str()` to examine data types and `summary()` for important statistics.
```{r}
str(cars_dataset)
summary(cars_dataset)
```
### Standardizing Column Names 
Substitute dashes with dots in column titles for uniformity.
```{r}
names(cars_dataset) <- gsub("_", ".", names(cars_dataset))
```



# Stage 2: Data Cleaning

## 1.Figuring out Lacking Values and Blank Strings:
We begin by checking the dataset for any missing values and incorrect entries, such as:

### Checking for null (NA) values
This detects columns containing typical missing values (NA).
```{r}
colSums(is.na(cars_dataset))
```

### Verifying if strings are empty
Find blank values in the 'Engine.Fuel.Type' column, indicating potential missing data.

```{r}
sum(cars_dataset$Engine.Fuel.Type == "")
# Empty Strings found only in Engine.Fuel.Type
```

### Identifying for N/A strings
Search for instances of "N/A" in Market.Category, as they might require conversion to typical NA values.
```{r}
sum(cars_dataset$Market.Category == "N/A")
# N/A Strings found only in Market.Category
```


## 2..Dealing with missing information (NA's):
Once we have found any missing values, we go ahead and use different imputation methods to fill in these gaps.

### Engine.HP 
Incomplete data points are replaced with the median horsepower, providing a fair approximation that prevents any bias in the data.
```{r}
cars_dataset$Engine.HP[is.na(cars_dataset$Engine.HP)] <- median(cars_dataset$Engine.HP, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Engine.Cylinders 
Similarly, any missing data points are substituted with the median number of cylinders.
```{r}
cars_dataset$Engine.Cylinders[is.na(cars_dataset$
      Engine.Cylinders)] <- median(cars_dataset$Engine.Cylinders, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Number.of.Doors
Unavailable data are substituted with the mode (4 doors), representing the most frequently seen arrangement.
```{r}
cars_dataset$Number.of.Doors[is.na(cars_dataset$Number.of.Doors)] <- 4
```

### Market.Category
We make missing entries uniform by changing "N/A" to NA and then substituting them with "Unknown" to ensure consistent categorization.
```{r}
cars_dataset$Market.Category[cars_dataset$Market.Category == "N/A"] <- NA
cars_dataset$Market.Category[is.na(cars_dataset$Market.Category)] <- "Unknown"
```


## 3.Handling Empty Strings:

### Engine.Fuel.Type
We substitute any blank entries in the Engine.Fuel.Type column with "Unknown" to maintain a uniform categorization of values.
```{r}
cars_dataset$Engine.Fuel.Type[cars_dataset$Engine.Fuel.Type == ""] <- "Unknown"
```


## 4.Dealing with Outliers:
The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is used to address anomalies in important numerical columns in order to maintain the integrity of the analysis.


### MSRP (Price)
```{r}
Q1_MSRP <- quantile(cars_dataset$MSRP, 0.25)
Q3_MSRP <- quantile(cars_dataset$MSRP, 0.75)
IQR_MSRP <- Q3_MSRP - Q1_MSRP
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, MSRP >= (Q1_MSRP - 1.5 * IQR_MSRP) & 
                         MSRP <= (Q3_MSRP + 1.5 * IQR_MSRP))
```

### Engine.HP
```{r}
Q1_HP <- quantile(cars_dataset$Engine.HP, 0.25)
Q3_HP <- quantile(cars_dataset$Engine.HP, 0.75)
IQR_HP <- Q3_HP - Q1_HP
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, Engine.HP >= (Q1_HP - 1.5 * IQR_HP) & 
                         Engine.HP <= (Q3_HP + 1.5 * IQR_HP))
```

### highway.MPG
```{r}
Q1_hwy <- quantile(cars_dataset$highway.MPG, 0.25)
Q3_hwy <- quantile(cars_dataset$highway.MPG, 0.75)
IQR_hwy <- Q3_hwy - Q1_hwy
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, highway.MPG >= (Q1_hwy - 1.5 * IQR_hwy) & 
                         highway.MPG <= (Q3_hwy + 1.5 * IQR_hwy))
```

### city.mpg
```{r}
Q1_city <- quantile(cars_dataset$city.mpg, 0.25)
Q3_city <- quantile(cars_dataset$city.mpg, 0.75)
IQR_city <- Q3_city - Q1_city
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, city.mpg >= (Q1_city - 1.5 * IQR_city) & 
                         city.mpg <= (Q3_city + 1.5 * IQR_city))
```

### Engine.Cylinders
```{r}
Q1_cylinders <- quantile(cars_dataset$Engine.Cylinders, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3_cylinders <- quantile(cars_dataset$Engine.Cylinders, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR_cylinders <- Q3_cylinders - Q1_cylinders
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, Engine.Cylinders >= (Q1_cylinders - 1.5 * IQR_cylinders) & 
                         Engine.Cylinders <= (Q3_cylinders + 1.5 * IQR_cylinders))
```

## 5.Correcting Unrealistic Values:

### Get rid of any rows in which Engine.HP or Engine.Cylinders have a value of zero or less
Rows with values of zero or less are deleted because they are not feasible for these characteristics.
```{r}
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, Engine.HP > 0)

cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, Engine.Cylinders > 0)
```

### Remove the rows with city.mpg and highway.MPG values less than 1 or greater than 100.
Limiting fuel efficiency values to a realistic range of 1 to 100 mpg is done to maintain accuracy of data and eliminate impractical entries.
```{r}
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, city.mpg > 0 & city.mpg <= 100)

cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, highway.MPG > 0 & highway.MPG <= 100)
```

### Setting rows with a Number of Doors ranging from 2 to 5.
Limiting values to fall within the standard range of 2 to 5 doors.
```{r}
cars_dataset <- subset(cars_dataset, Number.of.Doors >= 2 & Number.of.Doors <= 5)
```

## 6.Transforming/Converting Data Types:
For data consistency, we change certain columns to suitable data types

### Year
Convert from categorical to integer type to enable numerical analysis.
```{r}
cars_dataset$Year <- as.integer(as.character(cars_dataset$Year))
```

### Conversion to factors
List of categorical columns designated for conversion to factors.
```{r}
categorical_columns <- c("Make", "Model", "Engine.Fuel.Type", "Transmission.Type", 
                         "Driven.Wheels", "Market.Category", "Vehicle.Size", "Vehicle.Style")
```

Transform categorical_columns into factors.
```{r}
cars_dataset[categorical_columns] <- lapply(cars_dataset[categorical_columns], as.factor)
```

## Commentary: 
Data cleaning addresses missing values, outliers, and unrealistic values to improve data quality. This step fills missing entries using suitable imputation methods, removes extreme outliers from key variables, and standardizes data types. By handling these issues, we prepare a consistent and accurate dataset for reliable analysis in subsequent steps.



# Stage 3: Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Here, we use visualizations and summaries to explore key features and relationships in the dataset. Charts help examine variable distributions and interactions, uncovering patterns that inform our analysis.


### Dataset Summary
We begin with a dataset summary to review basic statistics, typical values, ranges, and any anomalies, guiding our choice of visualizations for deeper insights.
```{r}
summary(cars_dataset)
```

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```
### 1. Pie Chart for Vehicle Size Distribution
Shows the proportion of each vehicle size (e.g., Compact, Midsize), helping to understand the diversity and commonality of car sizes in the dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(cars_dataset, aes(x = "", fill = Vehicle.Size)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Vehicle Sizes") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

### 2. Bar Chart for Most Common Car Makes
Spotlights the top 10 most common car brands, providing insights into brand popularity and market share.

```{r}
top_10_makes <- sort(table(cars_dataset$Make), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
barplot(top_10_makes, 
        main = "Top 10 Car Makes",
        col = "skyblue", 
        las = 2, 
        ylab = "Count")
```

### 3. Histogram of Engine Horsepower (Engine.HP)
Displays the distribution of horsepower, showing common performance levels and any trends in engine power across the dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(cars_dataset, aes(x = Engine.HP)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Engine Horsepower", x = "Engine HP", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```     
        
### 4. Scatter Plot of Engine.HP vs. Price (MSRP)
Examines the relationship between horsepower and price, allowing analysis of how performance might influence vehicle pricing.

```{r}
ggplot(cars_dataset, aes(x = Engine.HP, y = MSRP)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Engine HP vs. MSRP", x = "Engine Horsepower (HP)", y = "Price (MSRP)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Commentary:
Through charts like histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots, we analyze variable distributions, relationships, and trends. This stage uncovers essential patterns, such as price and horsepower variation, offering an initial understanding of key car attributes that shape the dataset.


     
# Stage 4: Analyzing the Price Variables

We analyze MSRP to understand price distribution, categorize cars by price range, compare prices across types, and explore price-related correlations.


## 4.1 Summary of Price Variable

### 1.Histogram of MSRP
The histogram shows car price distribution, highlighting concentration, skewness, and any outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(cars_dataset, aes(x = MSRP)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of MSRP (Price)", x = "MSRP", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 2.Summary Statistics for MSRP
Calculating mean, median, and variance of MSRP provides insight into average prices and price variability in the dataset.

```{r}
mean_msrp <- mean(cars_dataset$MSRP, na.rm = TRUE)
median_msrp <- median(cars_dataset$MSRP, na.rm = TRUE)
var_msrp <- var(cars_dataset$MSRP, na.rm = TRUE)

print(paste("Mean MSRP:", mean_msrp))
print(paste("Median MSRP:", median_msrp))
print(paste("Variance of MSRP:", var_msrp))
```


## 4.2 Grouping Cars by Price Range

### 1.Defining Price Ranges
Cars are divided into Low, Medium, High, and Luxury groups based on MSRP, allowing for feature comparisons across price segments.


```{r}
cars_dataset$Price.Range <- cut(cars_dataset$MSRP, 
                                breaks = c(0, 20000, 40000, 60000, Inf),
                                labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Luxury"))
```

### 2.Summarizing by Price Range
Summary stats for each price range show differences in pricing within four price tiers.

```{r}
summary_by_price_range <- aggregate(MSRP ~ Price.Range, data = cars_dataset, summary)
print(summary_by_price_range)
```

## 4.3 Exploring Prices by Car Type

### Boxplot for MSRP by Vehicle Style
Compares price ranges across vehicle styles, highlighting how different styles align with market value.

```{r}
ggplot(cars_dataset, aes(x = Vehicle.Style, y = MSRP)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightpink", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "MSRP by Vehicle Style", x = "Vehicle Style", y = "MSRP") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
        
## 4.4 Correlation Analysis with Price

### 1.Correlation Matrix

We calculate a correlation matrix for numerical variables to find the top three factors most strongly associated with MSRP.

### Select numerical columns
```{r}
numeric_data <- cars_dataset[, sapply(cars_dataset, is.numeric)]
```

### Correlation with MSRP
```{r}
cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_data, use = "complete.obs")
cor_with_price <- cor_matrix["MSRP", ]
```

### Top 3 correlated variables with MSRP (excluding MSRP itself)
```{r}
top_3_correlated <- sort(cor_with_price, decreasing = TRUE)[2:4]
print(top_3_correlated)
```

## 2.Correlation Plot

The correlation plot visually shows relationships among numerical variables, helping identify key factors positively or negatively impacting MSRP.

```{r}
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)
```

## Commentary:
In this step, we analyze the price variable, MSRP, by examining its distribution, grouping cars by price ranges, and exploring pricing trends across vehicle types. Correlation analysis identifies influential factors, offering insights into what drives car prices.


# Stage 5: Effect of Brand on Popularity and Price
This section examines how brand influences car price (MSRP) and popularity, helping to understand whether certain brands are perceived as luxury or are particularly popular among consumers.

## 1.Average MSRP by Brand
Calculates each brand’s average price, distinguishing luxury from budget-friendly options.

### The average price per brand to see which brands are positioned as luxury versus affordable.
```{r}
avg_price_by_brand <- aggregate(MSRP ~ Make, data = cars_dataset, mean)
avg_price_by_brand <- avg_price_by_brand[order(-avg_price_by_brand$MSRP), ]
```

### Top 10 Brands by Average MSRP (Bar Plot)
Shows top 10 brands by average price, highlighting luxury brands.
```{r}
top_10_avg_price <- head(avg_price_by_brand, 10)
ggplot(data = top_10_avg_price, aes(x = reorder(Make, -MSRP), y = MSRP)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Brands by Average MSRP", x = "Brand", y = "Average MSRP") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## 2.Average Popularity by Brand
Measures brand popularity, identifying those with strong market appeal.

### The average popularity per brand to see which brands are the most popular.
```{r}
avg_popularity_by_brand <- aggregate(Popularity ~ Make, data = cars_dataset, mean)
avg_popularity_by_brand <- avg_popularity_by_brand[order(-avg_popularity_by_brand$Popularity), ]
```

### Top 10 Brands by Average Popularity (Bar Plot)
Displays the most popular brands based on average consumer favorability.
```{r}
top_10_popularity <- head(avg_popularity_by_brand, 10)
barplot(top_10_popularity$Popularity, 
        names.arg = top_10_popularity$Make, 
        main = "Top 10 Brands by Popularity",
        xlab = "Brand", 
        ylab = "Average Popularity",
        col = "lightgreen",
        las = 2)
```


## 3.Scatter Plot: Popularity vs. Price (MSRP)
Examines if higher-priced cars are more or less popular, identifying trends in consumer preferences across price ranges.

```{r}
plot(cars_dataset$MSRP, cars_dataset$Popularity,
     main = "Scatter Plot of Popularity vs. Price (MSRP)",
     xlab = "Price (MSRP)",
     ylab = "Popularity",
     col = "purple",
     pch = 16)
```

## Commentary:
Analyzing the brand’s impact on both popularity and price highlights market positioning and consumer preferences. By calculating average prices and popularity by brand, we differentiate luxury brands from budget options. The relationship between price and popularity is also explored in this step.
