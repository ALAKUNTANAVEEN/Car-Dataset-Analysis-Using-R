# Car Dataset Analysis Using R

## Overview
This project explores a comprehensive dataset of cars, analyzing key variables such as price (MSRP), horsepower, vehicle type, and brand popularity. Using R and ggplot2, the analysis reveals patterns, correlations, and insights into the automotive market.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes distributions, relationships, and trends using histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
- Price Analysis: Categorizes cars by price range and identifies factors influencing pricing.
- Brand Analysis: Examines brand impact on price and popularity.

## Technologies Used
- **R Programming**
- **ggplot2** for data visualization
- **corrplot** for correlation analysis
- **GGally** for enhanced correlation plots

## Files Included
- **R Markdown File (`Analysis.Rmd`)**: Contains all the code for analysis and visualizations.
- **Cleaned Dataset (`cleaned_cars_dataset.csv`)**: Processed dataset after cleaning and transformations.
- **PDF Report (`Analysis_Report.pdf`)**: A compiled report with all results and visualizations.
- **README.md**: This file.
